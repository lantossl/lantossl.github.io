      I started to be intrested in Linux around 2004. At that point of time I worked at the field of electric industry.

      In 2005 I started a new position as an airport security engineer where I had to facing with a lot of technical problems related in IT. That was the the time when I started to get interested in IT operations.

      In 2008 I attended to a Linux operator learning course which has been led at at an elementary school near my home. From that time, I started to dealing with Linuxes more and more while the year has passed.

      In the year of 2019 I decided to left my job as an IT support specialist to make a huge step closer to my goals. I got my first official certification in Linux in september of 2019. 

      I got my first job as a Linux system administrator at the State Treasury in 2020, when the operation of the instant payment systems has been introduced in Hungary. I worked for 2 years at that position until the April of 2022.

      After I left the Treasury, I decided that I start to learn for a higher level of certification and I successfully become LPIC-2 certified in May of 2023. During the time I'm not in contract with any company, I grab the opportunity to spend my time for self-improvement and get new experinces in one-time system adminisration jobs.

      Recently I focus on automating maintenance tasks in the infrastructure with Ansible.
